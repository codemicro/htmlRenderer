# htmlRenderer

This is a personal fork of the [Goldmark HTML renderer](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/blob/master/renderer/html/html.go). I would encourage you not to use it, but if you really want to, you can find the docs [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/codemicro/htmlRenderer) and you can install it as shown:

```
go get github.com/codemicro/htmlRenderer
```
